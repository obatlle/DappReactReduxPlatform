A simple mobile decentralized app ( dApp ) done as a prototype for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [expo](https://expo.io) to handle cryptopunks ranking on the ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

* It's basically a mobile dapp for iOS and android done using `react-native` and `web3`.

* It uses [flow](https://flow.org/) as a javascript typechecker and [babel-preset-react-native-web3](https://github.com/agrcrobles/babel-preset-react-native-web3) to polyfill crypto

## Getting started in localhost
 
Configure `Ropsten Testnet Network` mnemonic key in `App.js`

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# and from a separate shell Run the mobile app
exp start
```

For more information about configuring the cross platform app look into the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and [expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/index.html) getting started guides.

### React Native dependencies

### Ethereum dependencies
